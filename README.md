# READMEgenerator
Hello again graders hope you're having a great day. I still don't really know what to include in a READme to be honest. I struggle more with backend javascript and the new node es6 stuff we are learning I'm not sure why my code is not working but I actually put a lot of time and research into this so hopefully I didn't do too bad.
